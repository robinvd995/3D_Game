0. Debug renderer - complete
1. Basic AABB collision
2. Block textures, per side
3. Texture stitching, (frame buffers)
4. Netty implementation (just the basics), proxy with IProxy, CommonProxy, ClientProxy, ServerProxy
5. Chunk Renderer with Dynamic draw(make vaos from the chunks and render them to reduce calculations on render time)
